# Morphological Analysis for Korean Corpus

This project involves performing morphological analysis on a Korean text corpus. The analysis can be done manually, semi-automatically, or automatically using programming.

## File Format

- Each line in the sample file contains a single word segment.
- An empty line signifies a sentence boundary.
- Each sample file consists of 655 lines.

## Training Corpus

- **File:** `trn.txt`
- You may perform morphological analysis manually or use programming for automatic/semi-automatic analysis.

## Format Error Check

- Use the following website to check for format errors in your morphological analysis file: [Error Check](http://corpus.korea.ac.kr/errorcheck/)
- Ensure that the file is free of errors before submission.

## Error Types

- Familiarize yourself with the types of errors by visiting: [Error Types](http://corpus.korea.ac.kr/errorcheck/error_type.html)

## Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagset

- Use the SJ-RIKS POS tagset for your analysis.
- More information on the tagset can be found here: [POS Tagset](http://corpus.korea.ac.kr/tagset.html)

## Morphological Analysis File Format

- Each line should be formatted as: `"word segment\tmorphological analysis result"`
